# FIL – Front-end Interactive Libraries

FIL, *pronounced "Phill"*, is a collection of libraries built for the purpose of facilitating the development of interactive client-side components. Each module is loosely coupled and has no external dependencies.

[Check out a quick example](http://dannyx0.github.com/fil/)!

## Quick Start
 1. First, include the minified source or just the specific components you need.

````html
<script src="fil.min.js"></script>
````

## Components

* [Canvas.js](https://github.com/dannyx0/fil/wiki/Canvas.js) is a clean and easy `<canvas>` helper. [View Source](https://github.com/dannyx0/fil/blob/master/src/Canvas.js)
* [Input.js](https://github.com/dannyx0/fil/wiki/Input.js) captures and normalizes mouse & touch inputs. [View Source](https://github.com/dannyx0/fil/blob/master/src/Input.js)
* [Pen.js](https://github.com/dannyx0/fil/wiki/Pen.js) helps with drawing lines, cirlces and other shapes in canvas. [View Source](https://github.com/dannyx0/fil/blob/mast\er/src/Pen.js)
* [Frame.js](https://github.com/dannyx0/fil/wiki/Frame.js) is a simple polyfill for `window.requestAnimationFrame`. [View Source](https://github.com/dannyx0/fil/blob/master/src/Frame.js)
* [Transformer.js](https://github.com/dannyx0/fil/wiki/Transformer.js) simplifies CSS transformations. [View Source](https://github.com/dannyx0/fil/blob/master/src/Transformer.js)
